When `notify()` is called, one of the waiting threads is selected to be notified. `notifyAll()` notifies all waiting threads, but only one will proceed when the lock is released. Another way is through the `interrupt()` method, which signals the waiting thread to stop waiting and handle the interruption, potentially moving it back to the \"Runnable\" state if it was waiting due to a `wait()` call.
