These images are then assembled to create a more comprehensive view of the affected area. Georeferencing is the next step, which involves aligning the assembled images to geographical coordinates to accurately map the location of the observed changes. This is crucial for accurately determining the impact area and for further analysis. Once georeferencing is done, the overlaid satellite and destruction images provide detailed insights into the extent of the damage. Subsequently, the earthquake magnitude is determined, which is a measure of the energy released during the quake. Following this, the distance to the earthquake source is calculated, and the duration of the earthquake (earthquake lasting) is determined. These pieces of information are essential for the model construction phase, where a simulation model of the earthquake is created. After the model is constructed, an earthquake simulation is run to understand the dynamics and potential impact of the earthquake. Finally, the results of the simulation are visualized to provide a clear representation of the earthquake's effects, which can be used for analysis, planning, and response coordination."}]}

From the \"runnable\" state, if the thread is instructed to wait (e.g., if it executes a wait() method or something similar), it transitions to the \"waiting\" state. It can return to the \"runnable\" state from \"waiting\" if an unlock signal or signalAll is called. Alternatively, a thread can enter a \"timed waiting\" state from \"runnable\" if it performs an operation that involves waiting for a specified time interval, such as sleep() or await() with a timeout. After the time interval expires, it goes back to the \"runnable\" state. A thread can also move directly from \"runnable\" to \"terminated\" if it completes all of its execution. Similarly, a thread can transition from \"timed waiting\" to \"terminated\" if it completes its task before the time interval expires."}]}

The csi-provisioner then creates a new PV (Persistent Volume). The PV controller binds the PVC and PV. Once the PVC and PV are bound, the AD Controller (presumably Admission Controller) gets involved, leading to the VolumeAttachment. Meanwhile, a pod is created, and the kube-scheduler selects the appropriate node for the pod to be scheduled on. The kubelet on the selected node is then responsible for attaching the volume. This process involves the csi-attacher, which communicates with the csi-controller-server to attach the volume. Once the volume is attached, the kubelet mounts the volume to the pod. The final step in the process involves the csi-node-server, which is likely responsible for facilitating the communication between the node and the storage infrastructure to ensure the volume is properly mounted and accessible to the container(s) within the pod."}]}

The model suggests that the manufacturing sector, being more productive, can generate higher profits, which leads to increased savings. These savings can then be reinvested into the manufacturing sector, leading to capital growth. This cycle of reinvestment and capital growth further enhances the capacity of the manufacturing sector to absorb labor, increase production, and thus sustain economic growth.
